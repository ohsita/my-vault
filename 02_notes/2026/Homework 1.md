## Q1 HTGAAで開発したいツールとその理由

Through HTGAA activities, I aim to develop yeast capable of producing nutrients that are easily degraded by radiation within the body, and to create nutritional supplements utilizing this yeast. For long-duration crewed spaceflight missions, these supplements serve not only as a means of nutritional replenishment but also as one of the few sources of entertainment. While various space foods have been developed by different nations, most prioritize calorie-based calculations and preservation through processing, with taste being a low priority. Furthermore, various vitamins that should be obtained from fresh foods are easily damaged by radiation, posing a significant nutritional challenge during long-term stays. Technology enabling the effortless intake of nutrients is essential for humanity's expansion into space. By utilizing lipid-rich yeast, which has robust gene editing tools, to produce nutrients within the yeast itself, and developing nutritional supplements using this yeast, I believe we can contribute to replenishing nutrients that the human body often lacks.

To contribute to an "ethical" future in space exploration, this project must address not only nutritional needs but also the irreversible risks associated with introducing genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into closed loop systems and potential extraterrestrial environments. Therefore, we establish the following primary governance goal:

Goal: Establishment of a Biocontainment and Safety Standard

This goal is designed to align with COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) planetary protection guidelines and prioritizes three ethical pillars:

Prevention of Forward Contamination: Ensuring that the engineered yeast cannot survive outside its specific cultivation vessel, thereby preventing contamination of the spacecraft ecosystem or other celestial bodies.
    
Minimization of Mutational Risk: Guaranteeing that high-dose cosmic radiation does not trigger mutations leading to the production of toxins or allergens, ensuring the safety of the crew.
    
Psychological Welfare and Transparency: Designing the system not just as a survival mechanism, but as a trustworthy source of "comfort food," where the biological origins are transparent and ethically accepted by the crew.
    

### Proposed Actions

To achieve the governance goals outlined above, we propose three distinct technical actions.

#### Action 1: Implementation of Synthetic Auxotrophy (The "Molecular Leash")

Objective: To create a fail-safe mechanism where the organism cannot survive if physical containment is breached.
    
Design:
    
- We will engineer the genome of the oleaginous yeast (e.g., _Yarrowia lipolytica_) to depend on a specific non-standard amino acid (such as biphenylalanine) for essential protein synthesis.
        
    - This synthetic nutrient will not be found in the natural environment or the spacecraft’s standard life support system. It must be supplied via a dedicated cartridge.
        
    - Without this specific input, the yeast cells will cease functioning and die.
        
- **Assumptions:** The non-standard amino acid used is non-toxic to humans and remains stable during long-term storage.
    
- **Failure Risks:** The risk of "evolutionary escape," where the organism mutates to bypass the dependency (reversion), or horizontal gene transfer allows it to acquire the missing biosynthetic pathway from other microbes.
    

#### Action B: Genomic Hardening via Radio-Tolerance Engineering

- **Objective:** To prevent DNA damage caused by Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR), thereby inhibiting the evolution of harmful metabolic byproducts.
    
- **Design:**
    
    - We will introduce robust DNA repair genes derived from radio-tolerant extremophiles (such as _Deinococcus radiodurans_) into the yeast.
        
    - Additionally, the expression of antioxidant enzymes (like Superoxide Dismutase) will be enhanced to neutralize reactive oxygen species generated by radiation.
        
- **Assumptions:** The metabolic energy required for constant DNA repair and antioxidant production will not significantly reduce the yield of the target nutrients (vitamins and lipids).
    
- **Failure Risks:** Error-prone repair mechanisms could inadvertently accelerate mutation rates rather than fix them, or the metabolic burden could slow growth to inefficient levels.
    

#### Action C: AI-Driven Real-Time Metabolomic Monitoring

- **Objective:** To continuously monitor the culture for biochemical anomalies and automate disposal if safety thresholds are breached.
    
- **Design:**
    
    - Integration of micro-sensors (e.g., Raman spectroscopy or nanopore sequencing) within the bioreactor.
        
    - Utilization of a machine learning algorithm to compare real-time metabolic profiles against a "safe" baseline.
        
    - If an unknown metabolite or mutation signature is detected, the system triggers an automatic sterilization (heat kill) protocol.
        
- **Assumptions:** High-precision sensors can be miniaturized and operate reliably in a high-radiation environment without frequent calibration.
    
- **Failure Risks:** Sensor degradation leads to false positives, causing the unnecessary destruction of valuable food stocks.
