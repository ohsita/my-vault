## Development of High-Nutrient Yeast via Genetic Modification and the Creation of Nutritional Supplements Using It

### 1. Project Concept: Why Space Food Matters

In long-term manned space missions, food is not just a calorie source; it is one of the few forms of entertainment available to the crew. While current space foods prioritize preservation and calorie counts, "taste" and "freshness" are often secondary. Furthermore, essential vitamins from fresh foods are easily degraded by cosmic radiation, posing a significant nutritional challenge for long-term stays.

**My Solution:**

I propose developing a specialized **Oleaginous Yeast (_Yarrowia lipolytica_)** using metabolic engineering. This yeast will:

1. Synthesize essential nutrients (vitamins) that are often degraded in space.
    
2. Serve as a base for palatable, comfort-focused nutritional supplements.
    

By utilizing the abundant gene-editing tools available for oleaginous yeast, we can create a system that allows humans to "grow" their required nutrients on-site, ensuring both physical health and mental well-being in the harsh environment of space.

### 2. Governance and Policy Goals

To contribute to an "ethical" future, we must address the risks of introducing GMOs into closed loops and extraterrestrial environments.

**Goal: Establishment of a "Space-Grade" Biocontainment Standard**

This goal aligns with COSPAR planetary protection guidelines and focuses on:

- **Prevention of Forward Contamination:** Ensuring the yeast cannot survive outside the vessel.
    
- **Minimization of Mutational Risk:** Preventing radiation-induced toxicity.
    
- **Psychological Welfare:** Designing "transparent" food that the crew trusts.
    

### 3. Proposed Actions

To achieve these goals, I propose the following three technical actions:

#### Action A: Synthetic Auxotrophy (The "Molecular Leash")

- **Objective:** Create a biological fail-safe.
    
- **Design:** Engineer the yeast to depend on a specific **non-standard amino acid** (e.g., biphenylalanine) not found in nature or the ship's life support system.
    
- **Outcome:** If the containment breaches, the yeast cannot access this specific nutrient and will die.
    

#### Action B: Genomic Hardening

- **Objective:** Protect against Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR).
    
- **Design:** Introduce DNA repair genes from _Deinococcus radiodurans_ and enhance antioxidant enzyme expression.
    
- **Outcome:** Reduced mutation rates and prevention of toxic byproduct formation.
    

#### Action C: AI-Driven Monitoring

- **Objective:** Real-time safety checks.
    
- **Design:** Integrate micro-sensors (Raman spectroscopy) with ML algorithms to detect metabolic anomalies.
    
- **Outcome:** Automatic sterilization if the yeast deviates from its safe profile.
    

### 4. Evaluation Framework
NA

### 5. Prioritization and Trade-offs

**Selected Priority: **

I have decided to prioritize 

**Trade-off Management:**

- **The Problem:** Relying on a synthetic nutrient creates a logistical burden (if the supply runs out, the food source dies).
    
- **The Fix:** I will design the strain to require only micro-molar concentrations of the synthetic amino acid, ensuring a small, lightweight supply can last for years.
    
- **Secondary Defense:** While Action A prevents escape, it doesn't stop mutation. Therefore, I will incorporate elements of **Action B** (Genomic Hardening) as a secondary feature to ensure the food remains safe to eat.
